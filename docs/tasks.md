# WSL Monitor Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks for the WSL Monitor project. Each task is marked with a checkbox [ ] that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture and Design Improvements

1. [ ] Implement a proper configuration management system
   - [ ] Create a dedicated Configuration class to handle all configuration parameters
   - [ ] Support loading configuration from a properties file
   - [ ] Allow overriding configuration via command-line arguments
   - [ ] Add configuration for output file location, format, and other preferences

2. [ ] Improve error handling and logging
   - [ ] Implement a proper logging framework (e.g., SLF4J with Logback)
   - [ ] Replace System.out.println and System.err.println with appropriate logging calls
   - [ ] Add different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - [ ] Configure log output to both console and file

3. [ ] Refactor the architecture to follow SOLID principles
   - [ ] Extract interfaces for key components to improve testability
   - [ ] Apply dependency injection for better component decoupling
   - [ ] Separate concerns: command execution, result parsing, and output generation

4. [ ] Implement a plugin system for different distribution types
   - [ ] Create a common interface for distribution-specific operations
   - [ ] Implement specific handlers for Debian, Ubuntu, and other distributions
   - [ ] Auto-detect distribution type when not specified

## Code-Level Improvements

5. [ ] Improve code organization
   - [ ] Move all Kotlin code to the Kotlin source directory
   - [x] Standardize on Kotlin for all code
   - [ ] Organize classes into appropriate packages (e.g., command, model, util)

6. [ ] Enhance error handling
   - [ ] Add more specific exception types for different error scenarios
   - [ ] Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Add user-friendly error messages

7. [ ] Optimize performance
   - [ ] Cache distribution information to avoid repeated WSL calls
   - [ ] Implement parallel processing for multiple distributions
   - [ ] Add timeout handling for WSL commands

8. [ ] Improve code quality
   - [ ] Add null safety checks throughout the codebase
   - [ ] Apply consistent code formatting
   - [ ] Remove unused code and methods
   - [ ] Add proper documentation for all public methods and classes

## Testing Improvements

9. [ ] Enhance test coverage
   - [ ] Add unit tests for all public methods
   - [ ] Implement tests for the unused utility methods (isWslAvailable, getAvailableDistributions)
   - [ ] Add tests for error conditions and edge cases
   - [ ] Create mock implementations for WSL commands to avoid dependency on actual WSL

10. [ ] Implement integration tests
    - [ ] Create end-to-end tests that verify the entire workflow
    - [ ] Add tests for different distribution types
    - [ ] Test with various package update scenarios

11. [ ] Set up continuous integration
    - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI system
    - [ ] Add automated test runs on each commit
    - [ ] Implement code coverage reporting

## Build and Dependency Management

12. [ ] Update build configuration
    - [ ] Add support for creating a standalone executable (e.g., using jlink or GraalVM native-image)
    - [ ] Configure proper versioning
    - [ ] Add build profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod)

13. [ ] Improve dependency management
    - [ ] Update dependencies to latest versions
    - [ ] Add dependency version management
    - [ ] Consider adding more dependencies for improved functionality (e.g., logging, CLI parsing)

14. [ ] Add build automation
    - [ ] Create scripts for common development tasks
    - [ ] Add support for automated releases
    - [ ] Configure artifact publishing

## Documentation and User Experience

15. [ ] Enhance documentation
    - [ ] Create comprehensive KDoc documentation
    - [ ] Add architecture diagrams
    - [ ] Create user guide with examples
    - [ ] Document all configuration options

16. [ ] Improve user experience
    - [ ] Add a proper command-line interface with help text
    - [ ] Implement colorized console output
    - [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
    - [ ] Create a simple GUI or web interface (optional)

17. [ ] Add internationalization support
    - [ ] Extract all user-facing strings to resource bundles
    - [ ] Add support for multiple languages
    - [ ] Implement locale-aware formatting

## Security and Maintenance

18. [ ] Enhance security
    - [ ] Implement proper handling of sensitive information
    - [ ] Add input validation for all external inputs
    - [ ] Consider alternatives to passwordless sudo

19. [ ] Improve maintainability
    - [ ] Add code quality checks (e.g., ktlint, detekt)
    - [ ] Set up automated code formatting
    - [ ] Create contributing guidelines
    - [ ] Add issue and PR templates

20. [ ] Prepare for future enhancements
    - [ ] Design an extension mechanism for additional features
    - [ ] Plan for supporting other package managers (beyond apt)
    - [ ] Consider integration with notification systems
